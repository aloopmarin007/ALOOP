						<h4><strong>AbleGamers</strong></h4>
							<p>The story starts in 2019.<br>
								<blockquote>
								"I love video games, and my daily drive is the Sci-Fi Hardcore MMORPG <strong>EVE Online</strong>.<br>
								At the 2019 EveVegas meetup, the Eve Online developer CCP, organized a Fundraiser for the benefit of AbleGamers Foundation.<br>
								I attended the Fundraiser and this is where I learned about AbleGamers Foundation, their mission, who they are and what they do.<br>
								I think with Covid pandemic we all realized, the negative effects of social isolation. Now, imagine impaired people who live their entire life in isolation.<br> Gaming can make their lives better and fun and I believe this is the perfect time to raise awareness and promote AbleGamers mission.<br><strong>
								You can join this pool and be part of its mission, or you can help by making donations on their website here: <a href="https://ablegamers.networkforgood.com/projects/82475-the-ablegamers-charity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SoEveryoneCanGame</a>" 
								</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4><strong>Who is AbleGamers
								</strong></h4>
									<p><strong>The AbleGamers Foundation</strong> (also known as The AbleGamers Charity) is an American nonprofit organization and foundation dedicated to improving accessibility in the video game space, enabling more people with disabilities to be able to play video games. The charity creates resources, assists individuals in getting the peripherals they need, runs scholarships, and works with video game publishers and video game companies to improve accessibility.
									</p>
							</p>
								<h4><strong>What AbleGamers do
								</strong></h4>
									<p>
										<blockquote>"People with disabilities are at a heightened risk of social isolation, and AbleGamers knows that video games can be the perfect gateway to community participation, lifelong friendships, and unforgettable shared experiences. AbleGamers Mission: Creating opportunities that enable play in order to combat social isolation, foster inclusive communities, and improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.
											We’re using the power of video games to bring people together, improving quality of life with recreation and rehabilitation."

Official Member of Ardana Stake Pool Alliance (ASPA) partners.<br />It's official, posted in <a href="https://medium.com/@ardanaproject/aspa-partner-focus-4-announcing-the-latest-stake-pool-operators-partnering-with-ardana-362d938a95aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASPA Partner Focus #4 &#8212; Announcing the Latest Stake Pool Operators Partnering with Ardana. </a>&#160;This is a major step for us, colaborating with the First All-in-One Stablecoin Ecosystem Built on Cardano, an on-chain asset-backed stablecoin and a decentralized stable-asset DEX.

								<br>Nodes Upgrade<br /> 
									I'm glad that the upgrade went smooth without erros, compiling the nodes took around 1h. And they are running fine, purring like a kitty. xD

						<h4><strong>08/10/21</strong></h4>
							<p><u>PIGY Token is Here</u>
								<br>About PIGY Token<br /> 
									PIGY Token is a Cardano based cryptocurrency that is distributed by SPO as additional rewards to delegators.<br>
									There are around 2,600 Stake Pool Operators right now. Over 30% of these operators have never minted a single block, which translates to about 1,000 of them. Cardano Foundation and IOG are currently doing their best to ensure the operators of small pools survive, but they only have a limited amount of resources. We as a community can help these blockless stake pools by giving incentives so the delegators are willing to move around to a smaller pool and keep moving around the pools so that it will help the small pools survive.

						<h4><strong>07/18/21</strong></h4>
							<p><u>AdaLoop is now part of Mission Driven Pools Group.</u><br />

							<p><u>Cardano Single Pool Alliance</u>
								<p>It's official. AdaLoop is now part of Cardano Single Pool Alliance (SPA)</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/proud_member_of_spa.png" alt="" />
										<br>Cardano SPA – About
<p>"Who Are the members?<br>
Cardano Single Pool Alliance is a loosely connected group of separate stake pool operators who have all vowed to run a single stake pool for the sole purpose of providing the Cardano ecosystem with True Decentralization. Each member has unselfishly decided to forego the potential profit of running a stake pool in the hope of making Cardano one of the most resilient blockchain against any colluding or coordinated malicious attack from national governments, hackers, or the creator of the protocol. Each member strives to make his/her single pool profitable. However, when a respective stake pool reaches saturation, its stake pool’s operator channels help another SPA pool to reach saturation. An egalitarian decentralization of stake pools directly strengthens the resiliency of the Cardano network.  "</p>

<p>"Who We Are as A Group?<br>
<b>As a group, the Cardano Single Pool Alliance is camaraderie, not an organized entity, of single pool operators.</b> CSPA has no central authority or leadership. As a group, we aspire to an ideal – that only an abundance of single-owner-single-pool can shield Cardano against any attack.  We are bonded together by a single focus – that each stake pool operator should operate a single stake pool in the Cardano ecosystem. 
We are not a corporation, a bureaucratic organization, a censorship entity, a Cardano policing agency, or a non-profit. Willing and caring SPO volunteers, instead of paid leaders, runs and operates The Cardano Single Pool Alliance. We have no leadership, board members, or CEO.  We are a group of SPO with mutual trust defined by our voluntarism to accomplish a goal. To achieve our goals and maintain some sense of structure, we do have a “Participation of the Willing.” If you are willing to tackle a task on behalf of the CSPA, you are part of the core volunteer structure."<br>
